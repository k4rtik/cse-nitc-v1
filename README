These were the very initial versions of the CSED NIT Calicut website I set off to design.

These early versions were meant to correct few basic problems found on the then CSED site.

Few of the problems were:
- Incorrect titles of the web pages
- Global navigation structure not available on all pages
- Invalid links
- No uniformity in structure of the website

The first version 0.1.1 was presented to the HoD within a week of assigning of the task,
and was termed satisfactory for deployment but was held back for more feature addition.
