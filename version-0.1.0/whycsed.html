   <h3>Choosing our Department</h3>
   <p>
    This is what <a href="http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/dheeraj/">Dheeraj Sanghi</a>,
    Professor, CSE Deaprtment, IIT Kanpur and Director, LNM Institute of Information
    Technology, Jaipur has to say about our department:
   </p>
  
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     In September 2006, I had a chance to visit <em>NIT Calicut</em>, and I must say that I was
     very impressed. As you can see from the short list of colleges on this page, I do not get
     impressed easily. And let me tell you why. The first thing I noticed was that pretty
     much every faculty member in the department had a degree from either an IIT or IISc. They
     do hire people who have a B.Tech. degree, but then ask them to do graduate education from
     outside. In most colleges, they run graduate programs (M.Tech. or Ph.D.) primarily to
     ensure that their own faculty members can get part-time graduate degrees. But this
     in-breeding is dangerous for the quality of a department. The maintenance of the campus is
     another thing that struck me as something great. In many campuses I see buildings in black
     or green colour because of what they will like to claim is heavy rain. But NITC, all the
     buildings looked good from the outside, and I was told that they put a coat of paint
     frequently to ensure that the buildings do not look ugly. The infrastructure is very good,
     and is one of the few colleges who have actually used up the grants given to them under the
     TEQUIP program. The faculty is very cohesive. They have resisted the temptation of starting
     a program on IT. (Why shouldn't CSE and IT departments be merged in all NITs? There is hardly
     any difference in the programs, and these differences can be handled by offering electives.)
